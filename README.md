# Kafka Load Testing with Locust
This is a sample project that demonstrates the resilience and performance of an API architecture built using Kafka. The goal of this project is to simulate heavy traffic, up to a million requests, using the Kafka mechanism and stress test the API using Locust.

In this setup, Locust is used to apply a significant load (thousands of requests per second) to test the strength of the API. In testing, the API was able to handle the load efficiently without causing any issues for the database.

## Project Features
- Kafka for message handling: A robust messaging system that efficiently processes requests under heavy load.
- Locust for load testing: A powerful load testing tool that helps simulate real-world traffic and heavy request loads.

- Database efficiency: The API handles high volumes of requests without placing a heavy burden on the database, ensuring smooth performance.

### Prerequisites
Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Python 3.x
- Kafka and Zookeeper
- Locust
